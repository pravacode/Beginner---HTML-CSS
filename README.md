This is a very basic project I am attempting to do that was first introduced
via the Odin Project. (https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)

The goal of the project is to try and re-create the google homepage using 
HTML and CSS. Obviously I am not allowed to use the Developer tools to figure 
out how they styled something.

I am about 1 month into my lessons on coding and have decided that this would be
a decent first project to get my feet wet

I am also learning to use GitHub and how to use the command line in linux to 
create commits and contribute to a repository I have set up.
